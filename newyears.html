    <h1>Happy New Years!</h1>
    <p>Sorry for the cheesy 2007 looking website, this was a last minute thing.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It might already be 2023 for some of you, but regardless, happy new years! This year I went ahead and went out of my comfort zone, tried new things, and experimented with new hobbies. I've met amazing communities like Community Architects, buildergroop, and so on. I went ahead and finally started on UI/UX and graphic design a lot more, and my confidence rose in freelancing. I made a new community, and several personal brands for myself and what I do. I've made a couple of my dreams true already this year, and it was all thanks to you guys. :)</p>
    <br>
    <p>I hope we all have an awesome 2023, I already have things planned for next year, and I really want to get together with you guys in my server and freshen things up here. Perhaps it could finally become an active lounge? Anyhow, thank you all for spending 2022 with me. Even if it was just a simple DM, a donation, or a "hey", you're still pretty cool.</p>
